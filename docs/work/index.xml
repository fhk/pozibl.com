      <description>Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.&#xA;Since the initial description of Markdown contained ambiguities and unanswered questions, the implementations that appeared over the years have subtle differences and many come with syntax extensions.</description>

      <description>Often you want some subset of the data from the FCC BDC map.&#xA;That is a challenge. There is more than 2GB of data as each service location gets a record.&#xA;By downloading the data and grouping it we can make it more useable.&#xA;History There are many versions of this data but this uses the latest &amp;ldquo;*FibertothePremises_fixed_broadband_J23_28nov2023.csv&amp;rdquo;&#xA;https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/data-download&#xA;There is also data going back further under Form-477.&#xA;Example Data Processing import pandas as pd import glob from shapely.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Artificial Intelligence may not yet possess true sentience, but as it continues to evolve and learn, it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish it from human thought and emotions. As we delve deeper into the realm of AI, it raises questions about the nature of consciousness and our own understanding of what it means to be alive.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32198214</description>
