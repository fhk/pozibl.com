      <description>This covers my process and the idea behind getting broadband availability data as reported to the Federal Communcations Commision (FCC).&#xA;Background The most recent data was created as part of the new mapping iniative.&#xA;Now this data and process in itself is not problematic. The issue is that the data is not available in a format that is easily consumable. The data is available in a series of CSV files that are not easily consumable.</description>
