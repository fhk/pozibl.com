      <description>This covers my process and the idea behind getting broadband availability data as reported to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).&#xA;Background The most recent data was created as part of the new mapping initiative.&#xA;Now this data and process in itself is not problematic. The issue is that the data is not available in a format that is easily consumable. The data is available in a series of CSV files that are not easily consumable.</description>

      <description>Build a new app to use anywhere to determine the shade footprint of a new hedge or solar installation.&#xA;This app will use the Fused API to determine the shade footprint of a new hedge or solar installation. It will be able to determine the amount of shade that will be cast by the new installation and how much sunlight will be blocked. This will help people make informed decisions about where to plant hedges or install solar panels.</description>
